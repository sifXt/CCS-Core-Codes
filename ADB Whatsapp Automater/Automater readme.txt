1. You must have ADB Installed in your computer
2. Connect your computer to your OnePlus Nord device
3. Run "adb devices" in command prompt

What this does:-
This is an experimental program made by me.
I wanted to implement ADB and make a gui app from tkinter.
This app can open a device, send a whatsapp message to anyone, and then close the device.
This app uses coordinates to tap at the correct location, but I'm working on a program that does tasks by basic image recognition.
